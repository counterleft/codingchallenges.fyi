# Solutions to codingchallenges.fyi problems

This repo contains partial solutions to codingchallenges.fyi problems. I
started implementing solutions to these problems so that I could play with
programming languages that I was curious about or enjoyed coding in. This is
not intended to have bulletproof solutions but rather a place for me to play around
with ideas and learn new concepts. Please don't assume that you will find
correct or even idiomatic implementations in this repo.
